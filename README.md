# Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We are interested in this field/domain so as to humanize the homeless populaton that is ever so present yet invisible to our society. We want to show the inevatibility and causes of homelessness to create empathy for those who are suffering from it. At the same time, we would like to be responsible with our data and not reduce our subject to their conditions, which is why we are researching their interpersonal conditions
- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

Fortunately, there's many organizations attempting to battle homelessness with data. One of them being the [National Alliance to End Homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-2020/) whom have a visual representation showcasing the United States in its entirity. On this map, you can click different states and read the data that was collected from it. Additonally, there's the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness) that has multiple data charts on its website that show the number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States, United Kingdom and other countries around the world. Another example of data driven projects regarding homelessness was conducted by the [Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-success/access-opportunity-education/homeless-education/homeless-student-data-grant-recipients) that collected data regarding the amount of students experiencing homelessness in Washington state and there's the ability to check by county and district.

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

We hope to answer the question of how mental health affects and/or causes mental health; these two conditions have a symbiotic relationship and due to it we would like to analyze how these issues feed in to each other. We believe visual representation of accurate data will help guide communities towards humane and logical solutions to the epidemic that is homelessness. A question we have regarding data and homelessness is if there's more men experiencing homelessness than women, another question is if data-driven conclusions are accurate in multiple countries meaning if this is true in the United States, is it also accurate in other countries? Lastly, we hope to find data sets that can help us answer whether there's a higher proportion of people with mental illnesses experiencing homelessness. 

# Finding Data
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

Mayumi: I downloaded the data set of [Homelessness Data for Seattle/King County 1998-2020](https://query.data.world/s/l3lxcfp7dr2ovprrl6muth3acimfla) from data.world; this particualar dataset was hosted by Sasha Anderson, nd open to any organization who seek to use it.
Erica: I found two datasets that show the amount of women and men experiencing homelessness around the world since 1990. The first data set was retrived through [GAPMINDER](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/?embedded=true#$state$marker$hook$which=female_long_term_unemployment_rate_percent&scaleType=linear&spaceRef:null;;;&chart-type=spreadsheet) that shows the female long term unemployement rate. The second data set was also retrieved through [GAPMINDER](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/?embedded=true#$state$marker$hook$which=male_long_term_unemployment_rate_percent&scaleType=linear&spaceRef:null;;;&chart-type=spreadsheet) which shows the male long term unemployement rate in multiple countries since 1990.
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

Mayumi: from the "About" summary of the host: "This dataset is compiled from the Count Us In yearly counts conducted by All Home, the lead agency for the Seattle/King County Continuum of Care. The Continuum of Care is responsible for providing data to the Department of Health and Human Services in order to be eligible to receive federal funding. This count is conducted on a single night in January of each year."
Erica: Both data sets were collected by the [Internationsl Labour Organization](https://ilostat.ilo.org) which has significant amount of ethos so the data is reliable. I believe the data was collected through confidential questionaires in job locations therefore the audience are employees.
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?

M:The data has 24 rows in its landing page, but also more in different tabs containing information on reasons for displacement, services accessed, etc.
E: Both data sets have 120 observations to indicate which country the percentage (element) belongs to and what year (features).
- How many features (columns) are in the data?

M:There are 4 columns in the data's main page containg the basic information, though the data also contains multiple tabs with more specific information
E: Both data sets have 27 features to indicate which country the percentage (element) belongs to and what country (observation).
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

This dataset can provide a basic foundation for analyzin the homeless population in King County, and answers questions of the factors leading to homelessness, as well as how much does mental health impact homelessness.
The last two datasets can answer how many people (male or female) have experienced homelessness in 120 different countries in percentages/rate. We can utilze these data sets to answer which country has its citizens experience homelessness the most, what year this occurred, what country has the lowest rate of homeless citizens the past 27 years, the possibilities are endless.
