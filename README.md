# Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We are interested in this field/domain so as to humanize the homeless populaton that is ever so present yet invisible to our society. We want to show the inevatibility and causes of homelessness to create empathy for those who are suffering from it. At the same time, we would like to be responsible with our data and not reduce our subject to their conditions, which is why we are researching their interpersonal conditions
- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

Fortunately, there's many organizations attempting to battle homelessness with data. One of them being the [National Alliance to End Homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-2020/) whom have a visual representation showcasing the United States in its entirity. On this map, you can click different states and read the data that was collected from it. Additonally, there's the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness) that has multiple data charts on its website that show the number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States, United Kingdom and other countries around the world. Another example of data driven projects regarding homelessness was conducted by the [Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-success/access-opportunity-education/homeless-education/homeless-student-data-grant-recipients) that collected data regarding the amount of students experiencing homelessness in Washington state and there's the ability to check by county and district.

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

We hope to answer the question of how mental health affects and/or causes mental health; these two conditions have a symbiotic relationship and due to it we would like to analyze how these issues feed in to each other. We believe visual representation of accurate data will help guide communities towards humane and logical solutions to the epidemic that is homelessness. A question we have regarding data and homelessness is if there's more men experiencing homelessness than women, another question is if data-driven conclusions are accurate in multiple countries meaning if this is true in the United States, is it also accurate in other countries? Lastly, we hope to find data sets that can help us answer whether there's a higher proportion of people with mental illnesses experiencing homelessness.
