# Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?

  - We are interested in this field/domain to humanize the homeless population that is ever so present yet invisible to our society. We want to show the inevitability and causes of homelessness and create empathy for those suffering from it. At the same time, we would like to be responsible with our data and not reduce our subject to their conditions, which is why we are researching their interpersonal conditions.

- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
   - Fortunately, there's many organizations attempting to battle homelessness with data. One of them being the [National Alliance to End Homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-2020/) who has a visual representation showcasing the United States in its entirety. On this map, you can click on different states and read the data that was collected from it. Additionally, there is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness) that has multiple data charts on its website that show the number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries around the world. Another example of data driven projects regarding homelessness was conducted by the [Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-success/access-opportunity-education/homeless-education/homeless-student-data-grant-recipients) that collected data regarding the amount of students experiencing homelessness in Washington state (you can check by county and district).


- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

  - We hope to answer the question of how mental health affects and/or causes homelessness; these two conditions have a symbiotic relationship and due to it we would like to analyze how these issues feed in to each other. We believe visual representation of accurate data will help guide communities towards humane and logical solutions to the epidemic that is homelessness. A question we have regarding data and homelessness is if there's more men experiencing homelessness than women. Another question we wand to discuss is if data-driven conclusions are accurate in multiple countries; if it is true in the United States, is it also accurate in other countries? Lastly, we hope to find data sets that can help us answer whether there's a higher proportion of people with mental illnesses experiencing homelessness.

# Finding Data
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

>we downloaded the data set of [Homelessness Data for Seattle/King County 1998-2020 from data.world](https://data.world/sasha/count-us-in-report-homelessness-data); this particular dataset was hosted by Sasha Anderson, and open to any organization who seek to use it.

>another dataseet was downloaded from [DATALAB](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/homelessness-analysis/#section-geography). The data is public and available to download. However, I would like to note that it was updated as of November 2019.

- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

>from the "About" summary of the host: "This dataset is compiled from the Count Us In yearly counts conducted by All Home, the lead agency for the Seattle/King County Continuum of Care. The Continuum of Care is responsible for providing data to the Department of Health and Human Services in order to be eligible to receive federal funding. This count is conducted on a single night in January of each year."

>The data was collected by DATALAB from the following sources:
  - Homeless Population by Region - [USAspending.dov](https://www.usaspending.gov/search), [Point-in-Time (PIT) Data](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/)
  - Federal Programs that Address Homelessness
  - Comparing and Clustering Continuum of Care Areas


- How many observations (rows) are in your data?

>The data has 24 rows in its landing page, but also more in different tabs containing information on reasons for displacement, services accessed, etc.

>The data has 400 observations (rows).

>

- How many features (columns) are in the data?

>There are 4 columns in the first dataset's main page containing the basic information, though the data also contains multiple tabs with more specific information

>The second data has 25 features (columns).

- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

>The first dataset can provide a basic foundation for analyzing the homeless population in King County, and answers questions of the factors leading to homelessness, as well as how much does mental health impact homelessness.

>The second dataset provides information about federal programs that address homelessness and provide funding.
