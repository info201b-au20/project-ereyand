## R Markdown
In the Markdown document you create, you should run the other scripts to generate the necessary content your report:

Write an introductory paragraph explaining the domain/data set (feel free to borrow from the project proposal)
Write a summary paragraph that includes information calculated by your summary information function
Render your table and describe pertinent observations found in it
Describe the purpose of each chart (e.g., "this chart was intended to show the relationship between..."), render each chart, and describe pertinent observations found in each chart

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
